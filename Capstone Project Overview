PROBLEM STATEMENT

The real estate industry faces several challenges that hinder its efficiency, accessibility, and transparency. The problem statement underlying the information provided about the utility token for the real estate industry (OORSEEH Token) can be summarized as follows:

Inefficient and Slow Transactions: Traditional property transactions involve multiple intermediaries, such as banks, brokers, and lawyers, leading to delays, high transaction costs, and a lack of transparency. This inefficiency creates barriers for buyers, sellers, and investors in accessing and participating in the real estate market.

Limited Investment Opportunities: Real estate investments often require substantial capital, making it difficult for individuals with limited resources to enter the market. Lack of fractional ownership options and limited access to diverse investment opportunities further restricts participation and portfolio diversification.

Lack of Transparency and Trust: Real estate transactions suffer from a lack of transparency and trust, with challenges related to accurate property data, title disputes, and opaque market information. This can result in fraudulent activities, legal disputes, and a general lack of confidence among investors and participants.

Complex Cross-Border Transactions: Cross-border real estate transactions involve currency conversions, regulatory variations, and cumbersome legal processes, making them time-consuming, costly, and challenging to execute. These complexities hinder international investment and limit global collaboration in the real estate sector.

Limited Tenant Convenience and Payment Options: Traditional rental processes often rely on outdated payment systems and manual paperwork, leading to delays in rent collection, higher administrative costs, and inconvenience for tenants. Lack of modern payment options and streamlined processes can strain landlord-tenant relationships.

Innovation Gap: The real estate industry has been slow to adopt innovative technologies, such as blockchain, which could enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. There is a need to bridge the innovation gap and embrace new solutions that can address existing challenges and drive industry-wide transformation.
